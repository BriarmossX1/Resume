    <h3>Letter of Recomendation</h3>

    <p>
        September 26th, 2019
    </p>
    <p>
        To Whom it May Concern:
    </p>
    <p>
        It is my pleasure to strongly recommend Andrew Kirk for a Position with your company.
    </p>
    <p>
        My name is Brad Florence, and I am a Full Stack Software Developer at Global Awakening, as well as Andrew’s Instructor in the Front End Web Development class he graduated from. I have 6+ years of experience working in Software Development, and have seen
        many professionals come and go. Andrew is one individual I have met who uniquely stands out.
    </p>
    <p>
        During our time together, Andrew displayed great talents in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I was immediately impressed with Andrew’s willingness to help others in class who were struggling. During the time worked together, his understanding of Front End Web
        Development grew far more than that of the other student’s.
    </p>
    <p>
        He spent many hours outside of class, teaching himself to code, solve a variety of problems, and purchased extra books on the subject to gain knowledge far above and beyond the scope of the class.
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s not just his technical skills that impress me, however. Andrew was easy to work with because of his good attitude and motivation to learn new information. This was noticed not just by myself, but by his peers, who often relied on him to help them
        complete a lab, homework, or understand a specific topic.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am confident that Andrew would be a great fit for your Company. Not only will he bring the kind of skills you’re looking for in an applicant, he will quickly become an asset and help your company grow in any way he can.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you need more information, please do not hesitate to contact me at BradJFlorence@gmail.com or 609-576-6713. I would be happy to explain in more detail.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sincerely,
        <br> Brad Florence,
        <br> Full Stack Software Developer
